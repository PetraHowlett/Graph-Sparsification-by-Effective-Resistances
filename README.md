# Graph-Sparsification-by-Effective-Resistances
A simple python based implementation of the "Graph Sparsification by Effective Resistances" algorithm described here: https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0929

For simplicity sake the STSolve algorithm is replaced with a simple Least Squares solver.

This is a demo made to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm described in the paper.
This is NOT a computationally efficient implementation.
